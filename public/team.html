      <p class="intro">
        We are a passionate team of three developers who came together with a
        shared vision to create a dynamic and engaging weather-forecasting web
        application. Combining our skills in design, development, and
        problem-solving, we set out to build an interactive platform that not
        only displays accurate weather data but also enhances user experience
        through a visually immersive 3D globe interface. Our goal is to make
        weather exploration intuitive, modern, and enjoyable for users across
        the world.
